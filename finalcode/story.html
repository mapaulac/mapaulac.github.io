        <p class = "storyPara"> On the dawn of October 13th 2018, a group of organized people left the bus station of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, with the intention of arriving to the USA. This caravan offered the more than 7,000 Central Americans, who were able to cross the borders of Guatemala and Mexico and arrive up to Tijuana, the possibility to undertake this journey in a collective way.</p>

        <p class = "storyPara"> Before, this migration happened individually or in small groups: on top of the train called La Bestia or hiring coyotes for thousands of dollars, human traffickers, who often rape, physically and psychologically abuse the migrants or abandon them in the desert to die. </p>

        <p class = "storyPara"> The caravan faced the declarations of Donald Trump, who called them criminals, generating an alert in Mexico and the USA. The North American president, displayed 15.000 soldiers on the border and restricted the migrants’ right for asylum. The situation in Tijuana, where its journey ended, was complex and disappointing for many people.  </p>

      <p class = "storyPara" id = "storyTwoPara"> When we heard the news of the Central American migrant caravan we decided to document its journey through the Mexican Republic. We soon met a Honduran family integrated by adults, young people, children and an eight months pregnant mother. Yuri’s huge belly and the calm and secure attitude she had while carrying it, was the most shocking thing we saw all day. Her youth, courage and determination captivated us and we made the decision to follow them up to their final destination, wherever that was.</p>

      <p class = "storyPara" id = "storyTwoPara">We began the journey in the closest way: sharing the road, sleeping and waking up with them. We witnessed their bodies face long days of walking under the sun, rain and the lack of water and food. We lived alongside them the uncertainties they have to live with, but also the faith and illusion of the American dream.</p>

      <p class = "storyPara" id = "storyTwoPara"> Yuri, along her family, reaches Tijuana, just three days before giving birth. They gather the strength and money to cross the wall and immediately surrender to the North-American authorities, who will place them in migratory centers. There, just 12 hours after crossing, Yuri breaks waters achieving her goal. </p>
